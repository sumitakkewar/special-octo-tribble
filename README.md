# Season Life

## Question
    Write this scenario using OOP php;

    The following code must be based on a looping 30min interval.

    The sun rises at 6am everyday during summer, and 7am during winter. Summer consists of 10 days, and winter 12 days.

    The sun sets at 8pm in summer and 7pm in winter.

    In this scenario we will also have 4 characters namely a bird, a flower, a rooster and a dog.

    The bird wakes up when the sun rises. Once the bird wakes up he feeds. He randomly eats between 5-15 nectar from flowers. If he eats more than 10 pieces of nectar a day he needs to sleep. When the sun sets he also goes to sleep.
    
    During winter, due to the bird's habit of waking up at 6 am, during the 1hr it has to wait, the bird sings to make the time pass by.

    During the summer the flower petals open up and change from a normal green colour to a red colour for 1hour, and to a blue colour for the rest of the day and resets when sunsets back to green.

    The roster sings when the sun rises and the dog barks when the rooster sings, them being animals :)

    The above should print out as follows:

    [echo the day of the period] Example Day 1

    Time is 6:00am, the sunrise. We in summer
    Bird woke up
    Flower woke up and color of petals are green
    Bird Goes off to Feed on nectar
    Bird eats nectar x2
    Petals are red
    Time is 6:30
    Petals are red
    Time is 7:00
    Petals are blue
    [Echo the time] after each 30min loop interval
    Bird Feeds again x2
    Sun Sets
    Bird Sleeps
    Flower Sleeps

    Do a print out where the bird eats 10 and sleeps before the sun sets also.
